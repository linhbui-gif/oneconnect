Logins using a new device will trigger account restrictions and the Unrecognized Login email to send to the user’s email address.

If a user’s device changes during a session, iThemes Security will automatically log the user out to prevent unauthorized activity on the user’s account, such as changing the user’s email address or uploading malicious plugins.",
